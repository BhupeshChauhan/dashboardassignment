# `FROM node:20-alpine` in a Dockerfile is specifying the base image to use for building the container. In this case, it is instructing Docker to use the official Node.js image with version 20 based on Alpine Linux as the starting point for the container. This base image provides the necessary environment and dependencies to run Node.js applications within the container. The Alpine variant is known for its lightweight nature, making it a popular choice for containerized applications due to its smaller image size and reduced resource consumption.
FROM node:20-alpine

# The `WORKDIR /app` command in a Dockerfile is used to set the working directory within the container to `/app`. This means that any subsequent commands or instructions in the Dockerfile will be executed in the context of the `/app` directory within the container. It helps to organize and structure the file operations and commands that follow in the Dockerfile, making it easier to manage and maintain the container environment.
WORKDIR /app

# The lines `COPY package*.json .`, `COPY tsconfig*.json .`, and `COPY tsconfig*.node*.json .` in the Dockerfile are used to copy specific files matching the patterns provided from the host machine into the `/app` directory within the container during the image build process.
COPY package*.json .
COPY tsconfig*.json .
COPY tsconfig*.node*.json .

# The `RUN npm install` command in a Dockerfile is used to execute the `npm install` command during the image build process. This command instructs Docker to run the npm package manager to install all the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file of the project. It ensures that all required Node.js packages are installed within the container before proceeding with any subsequent steps in the Dockerfile.
RUN npm install

# The `COPY . .` command in a Dockerfile is used to copy all the files and directories from the current directory on the host machine (where the Docker build context is located) into the specified directory within the container. In this case, it is copying all the files and directories from the host machine's current directory into the `/app` directory within the container. This step is typically used to add the application code and any other necessary files into the container during the build process.
COPY . .

# The `EXPOSE 5173` instruction in a Dockerfile is used to expose a specific port from the container to the outside world. In this case, it is exposing port 5173. This does not actually publish the port, but it serves as a form of documentation to indicate which ports are intended to be published by the container. It is typically used to inform users of the image about which ports are expected to be accessed externally.
EXPOSE 5173

# The `CMD [ "npm", "run", "dev" ]` command in a Dockerfile is specifying the default command to run when a container is started from the image. In this case, it is instructing Docker to run the npm script named "dev" using the `npm run` command. This script likely starts the development server or application defined in the project.
CMD [ "npm", "run", "dev" ]
